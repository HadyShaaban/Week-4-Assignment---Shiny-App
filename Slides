## Introduction

Your body mass index, or BMI, gives a rough approximation of your body fat level. Doctors use it as a screening tool to determine if you're at possible risk of complications related to being overweight or obese. BMI is calculated according to your height and weight.
The body mass index is calculated from your height, inches, and weight, pounds. The formula is:
BMI = {weight \ height^2}*703
where the 703 is to adjust for units.

## Steps

- This is a project of week 4 of Coursera developing Data Products.
- Next slides contains R Code used to calculate.
- All what is needed to do is to enter your weight in pounds and height in inches.





## This slide show how to include R code embeded in the Application

```{r ,echo=TRUE , eval=TRUE}
##@show
foot <- 5
weightinbounds <- 66
inches <- 9
BMI <- (weightinbounds/(foot*inches)^2)*703
BMI

```
